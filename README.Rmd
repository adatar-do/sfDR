The goal of sfDR is to provide a comprehensive suite of simple feature (sf) objects for the administrative boundaries of the Dominican Republic, facilitating geospatial analysis and mapping.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sfDR from r-universe with:

```r
install.packages('sfDR', repos = c('https://adatar-do.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

## Example

This is a basic example showing how to use sfDR to plot a Dominican Republic province map:

```r
library(sfDR)

# Plotting the map of a specific province
plot(DR_PROV)
```
