The goal of sfDR is to provide a comprehensive suite of simple feature (sf) objects for the administrative boundaries of the Dominican Republic, facilitating geospatial analysis and mapping.

 sfDR is designed to be used through the rgisDR package, which provides the same and other functions for working with geographic data of the Dominican Republic in R.

 You can install rgisDR from r-universe with:

```r
install.packages("rgisDR", repos = c("https://adatar-do.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

You can visit the [rgisDR website](https://adatar-do.github.io/rgisDR/) for more information.

## Installation

You can install the development version of sfDR from r-universe with:

```r
install.packages("sfDR", repos = c("https://adatar-do.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```


## Example


This is a basic example showing how to use sfDR to plot a Dominican Republic province map:

```{r}
library(sfDR)

DR_PROV_SF <- dr_provinces()

plot(DR_PROV_SF)
```

Suppose you have a dataset showing the percentage distribution of remittances received in each province of the Dominican Republic for a specific year. To visualize this data using a graph with sfDR, you first need to combine the remittance data with the province data.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

 datos <- DR_PROV_SF |>
  left_join(remittance_by_province, by = join_by('PROV_NAME' == 'province'))

datos %>% 
  sf::st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  head()
```

To get the desired graph, just apply the plot function to your data.

```{r}
datos |>
  select(percentage) %>% 
  plot()
```

Next, we show how to achieve a similar result using ggplot2. This serves to demonstrate how to create maps in both ways and to highlight the simplicity of the process by integrating everything in one step.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

dr_provinces() %>%
  left_join(remittance_by_province, by = join_by('PROV_NAME' == 'province')) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = percentage)) +
  theme_void()
```
